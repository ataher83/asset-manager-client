# The Asset Manager

The Asset Manager is a web application designed to help businesses manage their assets and products. This application enables HR Managers to track how employees are using company assets. The assets can be categorized into two types: Returnable (e.g., laptops, keyboards, mouse, chairs, desks, cell phones) and Non-returnable (e.g., pens, pencils, paper, diaries, tissue paper). This web app requires a subscription to use.
